                        <a href="https://www.ursulakleguin.com/biography" target="_blank">Ursula K Le Guin</a> are the creatives by which I am most inspired. Based on the 
                        work I have produced this year and the way I intend to work going forward, I would describe myself 
                        as a transdisciplinary designer. I most enjoy working on projects which facilitate research and 
                        experimentation at the intersection of design, science, art, and engineering. Through my work I 
                        like to explore the relationships between nature, technology, and humanity because it occurs to me 
                        that despite our views of modern technology as being somewhat contrary to the natural world, human 
                        creations such as the internet are in fact as natural as nests or beehives. I therefore aim to 
                        question our definition of ‘natural,’ our fear, distrust, and demonisation of emergent technologies, 
                        and the relationships between both. I feel that I demonstrated this in in work which I completed for 
                        the Design Machines project this semester, for which I created a <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> 
                        program which receives information from an accompanying <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/about" target="_blank">Arduino</a>-powered 
                        ‘control’ panel, which the collaborator inputs via an array of potentiometers and switches. The program 
                        then draws lines across the radius of a circle (mimicking a <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=ppi%20radar%20display" target="_blank">radar display</a>) which are controlled by this 
                        information, which allows the user to draw entirely unique flowers in real time. Radar displays are often #
                        associated with military usage, but my machine draws flowers.

                        Recently, I read an online 
                        <a href="https://theface.com/style/metaverse-fashion-week-dolce-and-gabbana-selfridges-nfts-wearables-style?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-thefacemagazine&utm_content=later-25729622&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bio" target="_blank">article</a> 
                        by TJ Sidhu for <a href="https://theface.com/" target="_blank">The Face</a> magazine about the writer’s experience of attending 
                        <a href="https://metaversefashionweek.com/" target="_blank">Metaverse Fashion Week</a>, which was concluded by rather dramatically imploring the reader to “Choose 
                        life, choose a hobby, choose going out, choose friends, choose pubs … choose sleeping, choose waking 
                        up. Choose The Real World.” The entire article is so extremely techno pessimistic that the writer 
                        actually implies that attending a fashion show in the metaverse will automatically prevent you from 
                        going hiking or meeting friends in-person during the same lifetime. Ultimately, it is this concept 
                        of technology severing us from ‘real’ nature and thus destroying our ‘natural’ humanity that I wish 
                        to challenge in my work by utilising design to reveal the similarities between the mechanics of both 
                        nature and technology, and that our humanity is and always has been intrinsically embedded at their intersection.

                        Upon graduating I intend to continue to produce pieces of work along the same line 
                        of enquiry that I described above, but I am aware that realistically it is not the kind of work I would 
                        likely be able to produce for an employer. I think that I will either need to complete projects of this 
                        nature in my own time, or on a postgraduate course which allows me to do so. If I choose to seek employment 
                        upon graduating from this course as opposed to undertaking a master’s degree, I would like to work as a web 
                        designer-developer so that I can continue to develop my skills in programming whilst simultaneously 
                        utilising the graphic design skills which I have built during my studies.

                        My favourite example of outstanding design work and thinking is <a href="https://oxman.com/projects/aguahoja" target="_blank">Aguahoja</a>, an architectural structure 
                        made by 3D printing materials which are derived from fallen leaves, apple skins, and shrimp shells. 
                        It was created by the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/mediated-matter/overview/" target="_blank">mediated matter group</a> at MIT led by Professor Neri Oxman. The purpose of the 
                        project is to envision a future where abundant biocompatible materials sourced from healthy ecosystems 
                        replace current industrial materials used for architecture which are damaging to the environment. The 
                        structure is completely biocompatible and decays gradually when in contact with water – this decay was 
                        ‘programmed’ into the design to avoid obsolescence and waste, and to support the ecosystem it is placed 
                        in. This project inspired me to return to higher education to pursue a formal education in design, and 
                        it has largely formed my perception of what I consider to be a good piece of design. It embodies and 
                        accurately communicates the designers’ vision and message; the designers clearly considered every aspect 
                        of the final work and how it was achieved – extensive research into materials and methods of production 
                        which best aligned with the values and aims of the project was evidently undertaken. They adhered to a 
                        code of ethics regarding the collection of materials such as shrimp shells and leaves. The environmental 
                        impact at every stage of the piece’s life cycle was considered – how it was fabricated, its impact while 
                        it was on display, and what happened to it when no longer in use.
                        <br><br>
                        I think a piece of graphic design can be considered ‘good’ if it achieves the criteria for a good piece 
                        of design as described above and also when the graphic designer fully considers not only how best to accurately 
                        communicate their message and ideas within the piece of work that they are designing, but also how to communicate 
                        that message well to their audience. I think if the message is clear and simultaneously conveyed in a way that 
                        best addresses and resonates with the intended audience the design will be good, regardless of the aesthetic 
                        standard or level of technical expertise of the designer – I do, however, believe that technical expertise, 
                        experience in practice, and a strong knowledge of design theory can enhance the designer’s ability to achieve 
                        this and be more impactful where they do.

                    <p class="answer-text">
                        I think that design is largely about problem solving - figuring out how and why something works the way that it 
                        does and then figuring out how to make it work better or designing something new which works well when finished. 
                        This requires the designer to speculate about the future. This could mean considering how a poster could most 
                        effectively communicate its message and the best-case scenario if it does, or as with <a href="https://oxman.com/projects/aguahoja" target="_blank">Aguahoja</a> it could mean 
                        reimagining an entire industry or system such as architecture. This way of thinking speculatively about the 
                        future of society and human relationships with technology was first introduced to me through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction" target="_blank">sci-fi</a> genre. 
                        Through sci-fi I gained awareness that the way things work is not a default and are rather a result of our decision 
                        making as a society and as individuals. This inspired better critical thinking about how the world is, because I can 
                        first ‘play’ with and speculate about how it could be without the assumptions and biases I was otherwise unaware I had, 
                        whether I think that hypothetical way could be better, and for whom it might be better for. I think this also facilitates 
                        better critique and self-reflection regarding my own work and practice as I can think about a finished work as a synecdoche 
                        and consider what kind of a society it could be synecdochic of and how that matches up against the society I want to be 
                        part of building. This was important in the Discover Dundonian service designed by my group and I for the groupwork part of 
                        this semester’s agency project. A crucial part of defining the outcome was our consideration of the impact that the service 
                        would have on the community we were designing it for, whether that impact was positive, negative, or merely non-existent, 
                        and how to ensure that its functionality was optimised for the people we imagined would interact with it.

                        Communication is what creates and shapes our culture, and our culture defines what we as a society and as individuals 
                        deem to be morally acceptable or unacceptable. It is a common misconception that the primary concern of graphic design 
                        is aesthetics or decoration – I was once asked by a co-worker if I could make something “look more Apple-y”, but graphic 
                        design is more focused on producing effective visual communication, than simply making things look more pleasing. Now 
                        more than ever before, visual communication is an equally important and prevalent form of communication as verbal or 
                        written communication. Whether we are sharing information and ideas via advertisements, photographs, logos, icons, 
                        wayfinding symbols, packaging, games, memes, animations, etc., we are likely engaging with something which has been 
                        produced at least partially by a graphic designer. Therefore, I think that graphic designers absolutely should take 
                        responsibility for the messages and ideas they are releasing or aiding others to release into culture. For example, the 
                        term <a href="https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/transport-travel/what-greenwashing" target="_blank">‘greenwashing’</a> refers to when something is marketed as being environmentally friendly in order to appeal to 
                        environmentally conscious consumers, when it is in fact still harmful to the environment. Bamboo toothbrushes are notorious 
                        for being a product frequently plagued by greenwashing; the <a href="https://i0.wp.com/i.redd.it/u34j2rp0ihb41.jpg?w=615&strip=all" target="_blank">greenwashed bamboo toothbrush</a> itself is more environmentally friendly than 
                        traditional plastic ones but is still packaged in plastic where an environmentally friendly alternative, such as card, is 
                        available and more appropriate. The finished greenwashed product is ‘better’ for the environment than the fully plastic 
                        alternative, but not actually environmentally friendly as it is described. If the graphic designer was not responsible for 
                        this decision, they would have at least been aware that the packaging they were designing ‘eco-friendly’ graphics for was 
                        made from plastic. This is not only environmentally irresponsible, but misleading to the consumer and contributes to culture 
                        that behaving in such a manner is morally acceptable, which perpetuates the act.

                    <p class="answer-text">
                        I aim to never knowingly nor intentionally produce work which miscommunicates about its subject, nor is purposefully misleading, 
                        and to take responsibility for ensuring that I am not ignorant about anything that is communicated by my work, particularly if 
                        there is potential for that message to be harmful. I also intend to only produce work which is not in conflict with my personal 
                        values – if I don’t believe something is ‘right’, I feel strongly that I shouldn’t produce work which promotes it to others. As 
                        discussed in my answer to previous questions, I would like to use my work to facilitate and encourage healthier relationships 
                        between humans and technology, but not in a way that is blindly optimistic and uncritical of the risk involved in the adoption 
                        or misuse of new technologies. I feel that discussing, addressing, and de-mystifying those are a crucial part of understanding 
                        and strengthening these relationships. I wish to encourage humans to re-build connections with nature lost to pervasive 
                        anthropocentric thinking – the thinking that humans have become so intelligent that we have superseded nature as planetary 
                        decision maker and become superior to everything else in the natural world; that what we create is somehow inherently isolated 
                        from or to the contrary and detriment of nature because we are so intellectually superior to nature that it ‘cannot comprehend’ 
                        what we have made. I aim to do so by properly respecting all forms of life – human or otherwise - as different but equal, and 
                        therefore rejecting to work with the paradigmatic assumption that human life, and certain human lives, are superior to all others. 
                        I believe that working without the assumption that ‘humans always know better’ will facilitate better quality thinking regarding 
                        the implementation of natural materials and systems within my work and encourage me to consider the implications of projects to 
                        everyone – not just humans or a limited demographic of humans.

                    <p class="answer-text">
                        I feel that my strongest work has been work that does not necessarily fall under the category of graphic design and most of this 
                        work has been approached more as a learning opportunity or experiment, with the humble goal of expanding my skillset into areas 
                        that interest me rather than pressuring myself to produce a fantastic piece of graphic design. Particularly this year, I have 
                        focused on using each brief to encourage myself to become stronger at coding in preparation for the way I hope to work throughout 
                        fourth year – specifically; <a href="https://www.editorx.com/shaping-design/article/creative-coding" target="_blank">creative coding</a> (such as <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/g/generative-art" target="_blank">generative art</a>), electronics, and web development. I feel I have 
                        achieved this, and that as anticipated, my interest in web design has enhanced my understanding of typography, grids, and layout 
                        across the board. That said, I think that I still have a fair bit more to learn before I can consider the websites or programs 
                        that I am building to be strong examples. At this early stage in my learning process, the aspect I find to be strongest of any 
                        project I have undertaken involving code (which is both of them this semester) is simply that it all works, especially the 
                        generative art control panel and accompanying program I developed during Design Machines. Therefore, I think that the strongest 
                        aspects of my design work to date have been that in completing them, I have managed to learn the skills I wanted to learn whilst 
                        simultaneously producing what I think are interesting pieces of design which work as intended, answer the given brief, and prepare 
                        me for the work I hope to be engaged in next year, and ultimately beyond graduation.

                    <p class="answer-text">
                        The weakest part of my design work to date has been my time management. I consistently either underestimate how much time it will 
                        take me to complete something, or I overestimate how much time I have to work through a project and set myself a far larger task 
                        than is realistically achievable in the timescale determined by the brief. This generally leaves me rushing and corner-cutting near 
                        the end to meet the deadline, which results in the work submitted being completed to a lower standard than I know myself to be 
                        capable of. However, this semester this was (*<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ec/74/3b/ec743b15f19a63189599ad306b72ab2f.jpg" target="_blank">just about</a>*) not the case. I would like to say that this is because I have learned my 
                        lesson, set myself realistic workloads and managed my time well, but in reality, I just completely abandoned any attempt at a healthy 
                        work-life balance and grossly overestimated how long it would take me to learn how to program the microcontroller for Design Machines, 
                        which gave me a little ‘extra’ time to work on other areas of the project. I think going forward I can set myself more realistic tasks 
                        to complete relative to the timeframe stipulated by the brief, which should ensure that I have time to finish everything to a standard 
                        I am satisfied with, and I can be stricter with myself about building down-time into my schedule so as to avoid becoming burnt-out and 
                        overwhelmed as deadlines draw near.
